# Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm Implementation with Qiskit

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementation of the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm using Qiskit. The algorithm is designed to determine whether an oracle function is constant or balanced.

My implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of a classical circuit versus a quantum circuit. First demonstrating the structure and functionality of the classical circuit, and then the improvement with the structure of the quantum circuit. 

Also included is a brief explanation of Quantum Phase Kickback and it's application in the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm.
